1. You can find the python version of uniswap core contract in `Atomic_arb/uniswap`, which you can use to build your local quoter.

2. The basic code for decoding event stream, calculating saqndwich opportunity, and submitting bundles can be found in `BSC_sandwich`. Here I try BSC as the experiment place.

3. My articel "Review on ‘Burn incentives in MEV pricing auctions’ and More" can be found in `Articel_MEV_burn`.
